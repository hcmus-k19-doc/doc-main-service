# doc-main-service

The doc-main-service is an integral component of a microservices architecture, specifically designed for managing the Document Publication and Approval System.
This service plays a crucial role in facilitating the seamless flow of uploading and downloading files, while the actual storage and retrieval of documents are handled by another dedicated service.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following tools installed:

1. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
2. [IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (Please use IntelliJ as some configurations are specific to this IDE)
3. [Eclipse Temurin JDK 17.0.5](https://adoptium.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk17&jvmVariant=hotspot) (or any 17 version, but it is recommended to use the proposed version)
4. [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and use the source code:

1. Clone the repository using the following command: 
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/hcmus-k19-doc/doc-main-service
    ```
2. Start `docker-compose.yaml` file located in `etc/docker` using the following command:
    ```
    docker compose up -d
    ```

Note:
- If you are using an older version of Docker, use:
    ```
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
- To stop the Docker containers defined in `docker-compose.yaml`, you can use:
  ```
  docker compose stop
  ```
- If you want to remove the containers along with the volumes, you can use:
  ```
  docker compose down -v
  ```
**Be careful when using this command as it will permanently remove persisted volumes**!!!

3. Before using the source code, you need to build it first (this is a required step, not optional). Run the following Maven command:
    ```
    mvn clean install -DskipTests=true
    ```
Note:
- If you want to run the unit tests, remove the `-DskipTests=true` flag.
- If you want to skip the TypeScript generator, add the `-DskipTypescriptGenerator=true` flag.

4. To start the project, you will need to set up PostgreSQL database, RabbitMQ, and Keycloak, and configure the project to integrate with these services. You can set up the properties in the `application-dev.yaml` file located in the `module service`, package `src\main\resources`.
5. We also provide `liquibase` scripts to create the database schema, you can find them in the `module db`.
To run the scripts, you will need to enable `liquibase` and configure the database you want to use in the `application-dev.yaml` file.

You should now be able to run the project.

## Run the Project on Docker

Follow these steps to run the project using Docker:

1. Run the `build-image.bat` file in the root of the project to build the image. If the file cannot run completely, please copy and paste the commands in `build-image.bat` to your terminal to build the image.

2. Start the `docker-compose.yaml` file located in `etc/docker` using the following command:
```
docker compose --profile local-deployment up -d
```

**Note: Remember to configure PostgreSQL database, RabbitMQ, and Keycloak before starting the project.**

## Run the Project on Kubernetes

Before running the project on Kubernetes, make sure you have `minikube` or `Kubernetes` on Docker installed.

Follow these steps to run the project on Kubernetes:

1. Run the `up-doc-services.bat` file.

2. Run the `keycloak.bat` file.
